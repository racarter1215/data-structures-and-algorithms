## Description

A Python implementation of a `Reverse Arrayt`. Reverse arrays are utilized to manipulate data within an array to return data in the reverse order.

## Functions

| Function | Summary | Big O Time | Big O Space | Example | 
| :----------- | :----------- | :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------- |
| reverseArray | Reverses numbers within an array | O(1) | O(1) | reverseArray[10, 11, 12, 13] => [13, 12, 11, 10] |

### Approach

#### reverseArray()
1. Create an array with at least 2 numbers
2. Slice array
3. Return numbers in array starting with last number first

### Efficiency
* Methods that have Big O efficiency O(1) for time
  * reverseArray(). Because we are adding one or more nubmers at a time in a single array, it gets longer to do at a set rate
  
* Methods that have Big O efficiency O(1) for space
  * reverseArray(). Because it is only a single array with numbers, each added takes up the same amount of space, thus adding space at a linear rate
